typical meanings of abbreviated variable names in Andriy Kovalenko code
**********************************************************************

r = position
n = number
d = dimension
q = charge

at = atom
g = grid
u = solute
v = solvent

u = energy

l = limit (maximum)

lj = Leonnard-Jones
sig = sigma
eps = espilon

bri = bridge

ucu = coulumbic energy
uuv = lj then total energy

asym = asymptotic

delhv0 = eq. 20 on p. 7 of 2000 paper, 
       long range part of the total correlation function

ebuv = ??? (something about a repulsive bridge correction by orientational averaging)
TODO this has not yet been added to the Amber port, may be important!


changes from original code to periodic code
**********************************************************************

LJ -> LJ + (Coulomb potential + Tuv initial guess)
uljuv -> uljuv + (ucoulu + tuvini)
where ucuu was renamed ucoulu

bridge correction by orientational averaging
briavr

background shifts to correlation functions

removing periodicity contributions from huv and cuv

at the end, most steps are repeated for 3D-RISM/HNC(PLHNC)+RBC by MDIIS

uljuv(ulj) -> uljuv(ulj, urcuv, ebuv)

rxrism: c -> t
r1rism: c -> t, Huv -> Guv

removed: uuu, asympch, aexchem

replace c with t via the relation
h = c + t
t = h - c = (g - 1) - c
since
g = h + 1
