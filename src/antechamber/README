Installation and Other Documentation
====================================

antechamber is usually installed as part of Amber.

All of the documentation is in the "doc" subdirectory, in the Amber21.pdf
file.  See Chapter 2 in doc/Amber21.pdf for complete installation
instructions.  For the impatient, installation starts by typing
"./configure_cmake.py -h" in the build subdirectory
(or for the still supported but not advocated legacy build:
"./configure --help" in the top level directory).

For more information, including tutorials, bug fixes, etc., please consult
the Amber Web page:
